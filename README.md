There is quite a bit involved in setting up this lab before you get to step 7 and 8 where you add your own code.  If you get stuck, you can look at this working code to see where things went wrong.  I suggest that you follow the tutorial so you understand what is happening so that you can add your own code, but this may help you if you get stuck.
